# simple-linear-regression

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. A linear regression line has an equation of the form *Y = a + bX*, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable.

The case of one explanatory variable is called *simple linear regression.*
For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called *multiple linear regression.*

We will first learn to implement simple linear regression from scratch with python.
