# simple-linear-regression

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. A linear regression line has an equation of the form *Y = a + bX*, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable.

The case of one explanatory variable is called *simple linear regression.*
For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called *multiple linear regression.*

We will first learn to implement simple linear regression from scratch with python.

# Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).

## Dependencies
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

## Dataset
inusrance.csv -  swedish insurance dataset to demonstrate simple linear regression
data.csv - sample dataset with two variables used for the gradient descent example.

## Usage
* linearregression.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook to demonstrate code of simple linear regression
* gradientdescent.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook to demonstrate gradient descent using simple linear regression.
